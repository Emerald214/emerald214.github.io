title: Work Journal

Today my friend [@Genzer](http://genzerhawker.me) told he was writing a work journal to take notes of what he's done in the day.
I think it's very interesting for everyone to have a place to share professional knowledge, what problems we have and how we solve it.

That's a good idea indeed.
