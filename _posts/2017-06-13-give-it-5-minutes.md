title: Give it 5 minutes
---

Found that `tmux` is quite popular and many developers using it these days, I wasn't hesitant to give it a try as well as had a conversation with my friend about the hotkeys of `tmux` and `vim`. He told me that in `vim` we can use “hjkl” to move the caret and immediately I objected that  idea, I said “How weird the hotkeys are!” because it doesn’t reflect the directions like, for example W (up) - A (left) - S (down) and D (right) or the arrow keys. He was quite patient and sent me this link [Give it 5 minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) of Jason Fried and didn't forget to tell me "Give the article 5 minutes!". After reading it, I've figured out the attitude of a developer is even more important than his thinking and it should come first all the time.
