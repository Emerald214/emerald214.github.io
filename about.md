## Who I am

![Emerald Hieu]({{ site.avatar }} "Here I am")

Working as a developer doesn't take up my all time. I have a very keen interest in competitive outdoor activities, so much so that I seem not to be able to live without moving to and fro. While people are enjoying their good sleeps, I dream of leaping and scoring a goal by a header.

Since my childhood was largely surrounded by The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of the Earth and so on, I really love backpacking to distant lands and exploring the marvelous world.

I absolutely breathes English and once had the pleasure of being with native speakers with various accents from all over the world. That may be the most memorable experience I've ever had. 

"I'm on my way to finding my Personal Legend", I once posted that on Facebook.

## What this site is

In my opinion, more or less developers do not only work for their jobs but also have a duty with global communities. That is building up a better world of computer science where developers can learn from each other no matter how good at profession you are. Code Legend somehow is a way of sharing my knowledge at least with my friends and colleagues. Moreover, it's also kind of my work diary after a long working day about various fields like programming, architeture, philosophical ideas and so on.
